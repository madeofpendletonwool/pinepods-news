This update is absolutely massive and very exciting! It's the first that brings in Podcasting 2.0 support. This includes chapter support, chapter image support, people tag support, funding tag support, and transcript tag support! This update also brings in queue reorganizing features on the desktop version. Mobile touch support is on the way next. Finally, this update improves a ton of usability features for mobile. Mobile support is greatly improved on just about every page to some degree with some getting massive overhauls. As always, full release notes can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/madeofpendletonwool/PinePods/releases/tag/0.6.2)
