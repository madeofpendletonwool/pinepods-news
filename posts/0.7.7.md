# Pinepods 0.7.7: Revamped Notification System, Download Status, and Stability Improvements

I'm excited to announce PinePods 0.7.7, fully showing the power of the new notification system, things like episode downloads will now display percentages as they download in a brand new alert component that's been added. A worker system for background tasks that can be easily monitored on a per user basis so we can now get status of tasks as they execute was added back in version 0.7.4. Now we're starting to see what can be done with it. At this point I am confident Pinepods is the ultimate podcast archival tool. In the near future I will continue to migrate tasks over to this new system which will allow for even greater visibility into exactly what the server is doing. Think monitoring status of Nextcloud sync tasks etc.

In addition this update further improves some findings after the previous 0.7.4 update as it was a big one!

## 📣 Brand New Alert System
* **Comprehensive Alert System** - This update introduces a brand new Alert System Component that can be opened to monitor status of background tasks. Downloads are the primary use-case at the moment
* **Enhanced Notification Settings** - This update makes much needed adjustments to info messages and improves the look, and makes them less intrusive. They now show up on a timer as a small toast pop up. All tied into the new alert system.

## 🎵 Playlist Enhancements
* **Playlist Deletion** - Easily remove playlists you no longer need
* **Improved Playlist Creation** - Fixed specific issues with playlist creation flow

## 🔄 NextCloud Integration
* **NextCloud Removal Feature** - Added ability to delete NextCloud connections when no longer needed

## 🔒 Authentication Refinements
* **Finalized OIDC Error Handling** - More informative error messages and better recovery
* **Smoother Authentication Flow** - Addressed edge cases in the authentication process
* **Login Issues** - Took care of an issue where logging in a second time could sometimes cause an account not to be recognized

## 🎬 YouTube Support Improvements
* **Enhanced YouTube Download Task** - Implemented better download handling for YouTube videos
* **Improved Video Processing** - More reliable download and playback of YouTube content (and standard podcast content too for that matter)

## 💻 Technical Improvements
* **Migration Fixes** - Resolved DB upgrade issues when upgrading from version 0.7.3 to 0.7.5 or 0.7.4 to 0.7.5
* **Package Updates** - Updated a few dependencies

## 🖌️ UI Refinements
* **Download Page Context Menu** - Fixed context menu functionality on the downloads page
* **Adjusted Login Screen** - Improved placement and consistency of login screen components
* **General UI Polish** - Various small improvements throughout the interface

Thank you to all users and contributors for your continued support and feedback! Please feel free to reach out or create an issue if you have ideas for improving PinePods. Happy podcasting! 🎧🚀

## 🚧 Pending Tasks
* OIDC Documentation is almost done. I needed to address this login issue with it before I could finish it up. Coming very soon.
