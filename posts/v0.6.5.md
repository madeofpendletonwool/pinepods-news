This update tackles quite a few various features that have been asked for quite a bit. Podcast feeds with user and pass now work and can be easily added, the episode layout page can now handle podcast additions and removals much more gracefully, and you can now manually refresh podcasts! There's a button right on the home screen to quickly run a refresh. Plenty of additional fixes and cleanups have been completed in addition. Features are starting to slow somewhat as I start do everything I can to ensure a really polished experience.

As always, full release notes can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/madeofpendletonwool/PinePods/releases/tag/0.6.5)
