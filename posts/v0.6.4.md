Preferably, you won't notice much in this update other than the app being much more stable. This update is here to bug fix and cleanup little issues that have existed forever. Highlights include a home button that pops up when not on the home page to quickly return. Refreshing reloads correctly on every page now. Not to mention, it's now possible to share podcasts with other users on your server! You can open a podcast page and send them the url of a podcast you're currently on. It will open right up to that particular podcast for them. An example link looks like this: 
[http://try.pinepods.online/episode_layout?podcast_title=Ship%20It!%20SRE%2C%20Platform%20Engineering%2C%20DevOps&podcast_url=https%3A%2F%2Fchangelog.com%2Fshipit%2Ffeed](http://try.pinepods.online/episode_layout?podcast_title=Ship%20It!%20SRE%2C%20Platform%20Engineering%2C%20DevOps&podcast_url=https%3A%2F%2Fchangelog.com%2Fshipit%2Ffeed)

Keep in mind that will only work on your particular server. So that link above will always open that link on the pinepods trial server. You must be logged in for links to work.

As always, full release notes can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/madeofpendletonwool/PinePods/releases/tag/0.6.4)
