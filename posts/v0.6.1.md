title: Version 0.6.1 Released! Standalone Gpodder Servers now Supported!

A quick point release! 0.6.1 fixes a few problems discovered after implementing the new Postgres update and implements a few features requested heavily. The player now had volume control. You can adjust the volume of episodes right from the full screen podcast player now. In addition, external gpodder servers for podcast sync are also now supported. This means you can use projects such as [opodsync](https://github.com/kd2org/opodsync?tab=readme-ov-file) to sync your podcasts. There are options for username and password in the Nextcloud pod sync settings that make this possible. As always, if you notice an issue, open an issue on Github!
