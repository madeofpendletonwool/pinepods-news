I'm thrilled to announce Pinepods 0.7.1, the biggest release yet! This update brings Pinepods to every major platform (except ios) with dedicated apps, introduces significant performance improvements, a new host subscription system and adds a host of new features that make podcast listening even better.

üéôÔ∏è Introducing PodPeopleDB Integration
I'm super excited to announce PodPeopleDB, a new open-source project I've been working on that's allows the podcasting community to maintain hosts for podcasts that don't include a podcasting 2.0 Person tag. This deep integration brings powerful new ways to discover content:


Search and follow your favorite podcast hosts across all their shows
Community-driven database of podcast personalities
Automatic synchronization with Podcast 2.0 person tags to expand the functionality of podcasts that don't yet support the functionality
Real-time updates when new episodes featuring your followed hosts are released


This functionality was majorly inspired by an episode of The Changelog where they spoke about features that should be a part of podcasting apps. Listen [here](https://changelog.com/podcast/589)
I've also written a blog post going into more detail as to why I think PodPeopleDB should exist and some more of the functionality around it. Read that [here](https://www.pinepods.online/blog/2024/12/08/podpeople-db)


üöÄ New Apps and Clients


Announcing an Android App with full functionality including metadata and playback controls! There's some work to do on it yet for sure and it's in a bit of a beta state, but it's coming along nicely. In the coming couple of months there will be major improvement to it with a full release to F-Droid


New Desktop clients for every major platform:

Downloads page checkboxes fit in correctly now
Better loading states for authentication
Complete rebuild of the import podcasts settings screen which looks way nicer
