title: Version 0.6.0 Released! Postgres Support!
date: 2024-06-07

A new major release! 0.6.0 makes a huge step toward making Pinepods the best self-hosted podcast app there is! Postgres is now a supported database type. See the readme for information on that. In addition, the downloads page has gotten an overhaul. It now organized episodes under the podcast itself that you can drop down. This provides much better support for archiving large numbers of episodes. To further support archiving options, a download all button has been added to podcasts as well! There has also been some further options provided for podcasts also such as auto downloads on release and auto skip the first and last blank (you define the number) of seconds for a specific podcast. Perfect for those pods with large intros. Finally, last but not least a completed status has been added, you can either manually mark episodes as completed or when an episode is finished it will auto mark itself as complete. All that said, this was a huge update and a lot has changed, hence the major version bump. So please, if you notice an issue, open an issue on Github!
