title: Version 0.6.2 Released! Offline Mode and Local Downloads!
date: 2024-07-07
---

This particularly exciting release makes the Pinepods Desktop client a first class citizen. The client now supports downloading podcasts to your local machine for immediate loading or for offline listening. There's now an offline mode that doesn't require a login on the clients. You just hit the offline mode button instead of signing in and you'll be presented with all your offline downloads to listen to.
Other new features include PWA support. You can now quickly install a PWA version of the app by browsing to it from any browser that supports PWAs and adding it, and a new experimental kubernetes deployment option using an official Helm chart. The new helm repo can be found [here](https://helm.pinepods.online). Full release notes as always can be found at the Github Releases page: [here](https://github.com/madeofpendletonwool/PinePods/releases/tag/0.6.2)
