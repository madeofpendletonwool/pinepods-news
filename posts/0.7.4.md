# Pinepods 0.7.4: Smart Playlists, Homepage, OIDC Logins, and Notifications

I'm excited to announce Pinepods 0.7.4, a significant update focused on adding user requested features! Auto Generating and endlessly customizable smart playlists, options for OIDC logins, a brand new homepage, and notifications when your favorite shows release!

## üéµ Smart Playlists
- Smart Playlists - Create dynamic playlists based on custom criteria
- Specific Podcast Selection - Choose exactly which podcasts to include in your playlists
- Intelligent Playlist Refresh - Automatically keeps your playlists updated when you add or remove podcasts

## üè† Improved Homepage Experience
- New Homepage Component - Fresh, intuitive interface for better navigation
- Configurable Start Page - Choose which view greets you when opening Pinepods
- Experimental Finger-Hold Context Button - Quick access to additional options
- Enhanced Episode States - Clearly see saved, in-progress, and completed episodes

## üîí Authentication Enhancements

    OIDC login functionality
    Confirmed GitHub and Google login compatibility
    New component on the settings page to setup your OIDC compatible server

## üì£ Notification Support
- New Notification Setup Component in Settings
- Notifications can be sent to either a (ntfy server)[https://docs.ntfy.sh/] or (gotify server)[https://gotify.net/]. This allows you to send notifications directly to your phone about new episodes when they are released.
- Setup Notifications for specific shows on each podcast page settings area.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements
- Added image caching throughout the app (should improve load times when jumping between pages significantly)
- Added fallback options for failed image loads to proxy via the server if your browser fails to load them
- Introduced a worker system for background tasks using Celery. More tasks throughout Pinepods will be pushed off to this in the near future to improve performance overall but for now this fixes an issue where downloading episodes could prevent the server from responding.

## üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue where chapters sometimes didn't load due to incorrect headers
- Fixed filter button size consistency on Podcast Page
- Corrected user addition functionality in MySQL environments

## üì± UI Refinements
- Better podcast tile adaptation for large screens
- Adjusted Downloads page for more efficient use of space and overall look is more polished
- Added filtering options for incomplete/complete episodes on Podcast page

Thank you to all users and contributors for your continued support! Please feel free to reach out or create an issue if you have ideas for improving Pinepods! We're nearing what I'm considering a feature-complete v1 at this point.

Happy podcasting! üéßüöÄ
