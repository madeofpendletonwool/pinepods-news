## üß† Smarter Backend, Cleaner Sync

* **Unique RSS Feed Keys** ‚Äì Every generated feed now includes a unique key to make external syncs more robust and secure. There are some minor issues to clean up with rss deployment but at this point is should really extremely consistent to share rss feeds from Pinepods to external apps

## üîä Playback Polish
